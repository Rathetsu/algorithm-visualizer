export const BUBBLE_SORT_DESCRIPTION = `Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues iterating through the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted, making it inefficient for large lists.`;

export const MERGE_SORT_DESCRIPTION = `Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm that works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of items being sorted, making it more efficient than Bubble Sort, especially for larger lists.`;

export const HEAP_SORT_DESCRIPTION = `Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, iteratively shrinking the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. Heap Sort uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently find the largest unsorted element. Heap Sort has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of items being sorted, making it more efficient than Bubble Sort and similar in performance to Merge Sort.`;

export const QUICK_SORT_DESCRIPTION = `Quick Sort is a highly efficient and widely-used sorting algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two groups - those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The lesser and greater groups are then sorted recursively. Quick Sort's average-case time complexity is O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of items being sorted. However, its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), although this can be avoided with proper selection of pivot elements. Quick Sort is generally faster in practice than other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort due to its efficient memory usage and cache performance.`;
